## Past Events

BAS conducted a practical amateur astronomy workshop in Coorg during December 2013, just before the new year's eve, with great success! We had 18 telescopes on the field. The event lasted for three nights. Some very advanced observations were performed, possibly for the first time ever from Indian soil.

There are no planned upcoming events, but some of our members are actively observing whenever the skies are clear, and you can join their trips. Subscribe to the mailing list and follow the discussions to keep track of unofficial events.
